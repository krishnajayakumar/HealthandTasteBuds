# HealthandTasteBuds
This project aims to build a platform to enable general public and restaurant managers to improve their diet choices and food quality/services respectively. The application uses the preferences and requirements of the user to suggest matching food items (satisfying nutrition, calorie, taste preferences) which can be ordered online. These food outlets can give the ingredients of their food items and the nutritional value of the items will be calculated and displayed by the system. The users of this application can rate, review, comment, tag or share posts related to these food outlets and explore the nutritional information of specific dishes and meals.
